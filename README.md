# React Chat Application

A simple chat application built with React, SQLLite, Node, Socket.IO, and Express. 
This application provides a proof-of-concept for building a chat application similar to WhatsApp.


## Installation

To install and set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-chat-app.git
```
2. Install dependencies for the client-side:

```bash
cd ./client
npm install
```

3. Install dependencies for the server-side:

```bash
cd ./server
npm install
```

## Usage

To use the chat application, follow these steps:

1. Start the server:

```bash
cd server
node app.js
```

2. Launch the client application:

```bash
cd client
npm start
```

3. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the chat application. Feel free to open it in multiple browsers at the same time to have a little chat with yourself


#FYI
```
I've included a tiny dummy data database file located at ./server/chat.db, you can delete it to start a fresh one. Just restart the backend.
```

ENJOY!
